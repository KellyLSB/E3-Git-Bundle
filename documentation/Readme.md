About the GIT Bundle
====================
The GIT bundle provides versioning information about your current installation as well as the ability to update your installation with the click of a button. This bundle is used exclusively from the /@manage panel, and can be found under the "GIT" tile. Slow page loading is normal. This means that it is downloading refs from the remote server to show you changes (these refs will not be merged into your local installation until you git "PULL" in the top right corner of the page).

Dependencies
============
- Access to the shell_exec() method.
